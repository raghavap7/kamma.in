                            <span class="project-tagline">Naidu was drawn to politics at an early age, and joined Youth Congress as a student leader in Chandragiri, near Tirupati. After emergency was imposed on the country in 1975, he became close supporter of Youth Congress president, Sanjay Gandhi.

In the elections, the TDP won by an absolute majority, winning 199 out of the 294 seats in the state assembly, with NTR himself winning both the seats he contested.[36][37] Their alliance with the Sanjaya Vichara Manch fetched 202 seats.[citation needed] NTR was sworn in as the 10th and the first non-Congress Chief Minister of the state on 9 January 1983 with ten cabinet ministers and five ministers of State.</span>

                            <span class="project-tagline">Naidu became a Congress member of the Andhra Pradesh legislative assembly (MLA) for Chandragiri constituency in 1978. The party's 20% quota for youth to run for the office was beneficial for Naidu on that occasion. Not long afterwards, he was appointed as technical education and cinematography minister in T .Anjaiah's government at the age of 28.[18] He was the youngest minister in the Congress(I) cabinet.[19]

As the cinematography minister, Naidu came in contact with N. T. Rama Rao, popularly known as NTR, a popular film star in Telugu cinema. In 1980, he married Bhuvaneswari, NTR's third daughter.</span>

                            <span class="project-tagline">Naidu got the chance to show his political skills in August 1984, when Nadendla Bhaskara Rao staged a coup against NTR. He rallied the TDP MLAs together, and paraded them before the President of India. NTR was reinstated as the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh 31 days later. Impressed with his son-in-law's manoeuvres, NTR appointed Naidu general secretary of the party and he began playing an important role in the TDP after Rao's coup attempt.</span>

His role during this phase both inside the Legislative Assembly and outside was a critical factor for the subsequent success of the party at the hustings.</span>

Aparisim Ghosh of the American news magazine, Time commented, "In just five years, he has turned an impoverished, rural backwater place into India's new information-technology hub",[5] and the magazine named him South Asian of the Year.[25]</span>
